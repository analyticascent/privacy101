# Privacy 101
A non-technical collection of resources on privacy applications and services, as well as best practices. I started this repo as a way to share some markdown files I was working on and passing around.

**Nothing in this repo requires any knowledge of how to code, only a basic sense of how to install things on your device operating system.** Less emphasis will be placed on the "crypto" space (Bitcoin, altcoins, dApps, etc) because that space is evolving too quickly for most newcomers to keep up. More emphasis however will be placed on tools and services that require *no subscription fees,* and are likely to remain valuable for the *next few years* at a minimum.

Here are the documents (available as both markdown files and printer-friendly PDFs):

&nbsp;

1. **Applications & Services:** This contains both a summary of why government surveillance and current data broker practices are worth defending against, and a list of tools/services that are free to use as well as easy to install.

2. **Protocols & the Deep Web:** Anything from Tor, to IPFS, to Freenet, and so on. This is an overview of secure alternatives to the "normal" internet.

3. **Personal Firewall Checklist:** This contains a condensed summary of the information from the previous two sections, and organized in a way that emphasizes how you would put such information into practice.
