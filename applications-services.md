# Privacy 101: Applications & Services

*For a printer-friendly version of this document, [click here](https://github.com/analyticascent/privacy101/blob/master/application-services.pdf).*

**Summary:** The following links give a good overview of why mass surveilliance by governments is counterproductive, how "data brokers" gather data on consumers, and what happens in a country that combines the worst of both in order to control it's citizens. There's so much more that could be added here, but this should be more than enough to convince most people that there's a lot at stake here.

## Core Privacy Applications & Services

#1. **https://Brave.com:** This is a browser that should come by default with every major operating system. There are many unique features that come with it, including ad-blockers, Tor functionality, and a revolutionary new way for websites to monetize their content without the traditional stalker-ad technology they've relied on.

* Change the default search engine to **https://StartPage.com** and you'll be using the most secure search engine available. That search engine better conceals what you're searching for in the URL address, and even allows you to visit a given page from behind a proxy.
* Brave also has the added benefit of being able to use most Chromium extensions, can display torrents directly from magnet links, and it also allows you to use Jitsi (discussed below) for screensharing without having to install another extension.
* The "Brave Rewards" feature not only is a great way to challenge the existing ad-revenue model the web has been plagued by, but it also doubles as an interesting gateway into the cryptocurrency space.

&nbsp;

#2. **https://Jitsi.org:** Everything you typically rely on Skype or Google Hangouts for, Jitsi can do with end-to-end encryption. From the **https://meet.jit.si/** page, you can set up a video chatroom without installing anything - it will run directly from most browsers, and can even do screen sharing with no added extensions within Brave browser. Also:

* Shared document editing with Etherpad, which even allows you to "play back" who did what edits.
* You can add password protection to meetings, disable audio and/or video, and use text chat simultaneously.
* Users can also *"call in"* to a chatroom by dialing a number and using it via audio only (very Skype-like).

&nbsp;

#3. **https://Signal.org:** If you have an Android phone or iPhone, you should be using this as your default messaging app. You can send the same text messages or phone calls you normally would, but with end-to-end encryption and without the fees normally associated with SMS/MMS messaging, or long-distance call charges. It can even run as a desktop application as well. And if you're really concerned about privacy, messages can be timed to self-destruct.

&nbsp;

#4. **https://Keybase.io:** This can be thought of as an end-to-end encrypted alternative to Slack. Keybase allows you to message individuals or even groups of people as a team. It was originally developed to solve a problem that traditional public key encryption had, which was proving that a key really belonged to you. Keybase allows you to verify your identity through social media accounts (which can also be pseudonymous by the way...) so no one can impersonate you.

* You can share small files to other users, and even utilize version control on them (and with git repos).
* A single user can run it from desktop and mobile devices - very similar to better-known tools such as Slack.

&nbsp;

#5. **https://Privacy.com:** This is more of a service than an app. It allows you to make online purchases using "virtual" debit card numbers that can be generated and used once, set to work only with a single merchant, or even have limits on how much money can be spent per month. Best of all, it allows you to make payments without giving them your real debit or credit card numbers - let alone your real name. Any site that takes prepaid debit cards will accept these for payment.
